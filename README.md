# Introduction


This initiative aims to develop an extensive and robust library of image processing functions, implemented in the C programming language. The ultimate objective is to establish a versatile platform capable of ingesting PPM images, executing a range of filters and transformations, and subsequently generating a modified image file. It is important to note that this project is currently in active development, with ongoing efforts to enhance its capabilities.

### Software Information

* Developed with " C " Programming Language
* Development Setup and Wiki built for Visual Studio Code
* Uses Libraries such as " GTK4 ", " JpegLib ", "PngLib ", Additional added in the future.
